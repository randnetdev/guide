Hi, and welcome to section 9.
<br>
I know this has been grueling, but there is literally one last thing you have to do.

Please let Dora know if there are any bugs, and bugfix commits will be promptly pushed within 24 hours.
<br>
Thanks for sticking it out, and see you in the modem guide when it comes out on part 2 of fully configuring DoraOS?
