## How to install DoraOS.
DoraOS was made a anonymous developer who wishes to not be named, but was made specifcally for Dora's project.

First off, you're going need the DoraOS image, you can ask Dora for the firmware download link, and you should recieve a ZSD file.

From there, you're going to have to install 
and run the installer, and hit Install. You'll need to install Raspberry Pi Imager or similar flashing software. (Rufus may not work)
Raspberry Pi Imager can be found in the [Links](#links) Section.

## Installing an SSH Client (or not)
You'll need to install an SSH Client, (Windows 10, and Windows 11 include an ssh client via cmd.exe since Windows 10 1709) in Windows 10 & Windows 11.

From there, you're set to begin. Right click on the zsd file and go to 7Zip-ZS>Extract files... and specify a location where you want your firmware to be
extracted.

Then, open Raspberry Pi Imager, click "CHOOSE OS" scroll down to the bottom and click "Use custom", next click "CHOOSE STORAGE" and select the 32GB SD Card you are flashing to (DoraOS is too large to fit onto any card under 32GB!), then select the
  DoraOS_BG3LN79ZEFHGXDGTVTA88CNUDD4RCVKK_Firmv1.img file, and click "WRITE". This will write DoraOS to your SD card.
