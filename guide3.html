Hi. Welcome to section 3 of installing DoraOS.
<br>
First off, we're going to want to configure our line in loopback. In the future, DoraOS will be able to, as long as you're recording,
say out loud various debug and error messages, so you're going to optionally, but most likely, want to do this.
<br>
Firstly, you're going to want to install Audacity, which can be found <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/download/windows/">here</a>.
<br>
Next, we're going to want to open it. It should look like this: <img src="/images/audacity.png"> 
<br>
Next, we're going to enable WASAPI. Choose the following option here to do so: <img src="/images/hosts.png"> 
<br>
Lastly, we're going to want to select our loopback device. It should have something similar to "Line In". <img src="/images/audacity-select-audio-devicd.png">
<br>
Now, whenever you use the 64DD, we recommend hitting the circular record button, so in case you run into errors,
and need help, you can play it back later, in future  versions of the firmware, so Dora can help you easier.
