Once you have obtained your hardware, connect the AUX cable from the Pi to your line in port on your PC. Then, connect the micro usb cable to the power plug. It's recommended to have a power strip, and this specific power plug, because otherwise 1. your Pi will not have enough power and break, and 2. you're going to need a lot of plugs for later on in the guide. From there, connect the HDMI cable to the extender, then bend the extender to the exact angle it's inserting into your HDMI monitor. This is important if you don't want your cable breaking within a few weeks. Next, apply the heatsinks. DoraOS uses quite the tempature, so it's recommened, but optional to have these, we won't say we didn't warn you. Next, connect the power plug into the power strip, and connect the power strip into the source. At last, you finally have your offical firmware pi kit ready to go!
