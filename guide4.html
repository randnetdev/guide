Hi, and welcome to section 4.
<br>
First off, you're going to want to connect your Pi to the internet. This can be done, by ethernet, or our wifi emulator solution, which you can view
instructions at <a href="/guide/wifi.html">here</a>.
<br>
Next, you're going to want to flip on and off the switch on your power strip, with a five second interval, 
abd you're going to want to turn on your Pi's HDMI monitor and login, then note down the IP it gives you.
<br>
Next open Putty, and place that IP in the IP box,
<br>
Next, name your profile and hit save settings.
<br>
Next, hit Open.
<br>
Next, login with root, and password "dietpi" without quotes., and be sure to change your password by using the
"passwd" command if you feel like it.
<br>
You've now connected!
