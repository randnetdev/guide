Hi, and welcome to section 4.
<br>
First off, you're going to want to connect your Pi to the internet. This can be done, by ethernet, or our wifi emulator solution, which you can view
instructions at <a href="/guide/wifi.html">here</a>.
<br>
Since you have chosen ethernet, you will need one thing: you're going to need a micro SD card reader. 
Might we suggest <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/184901848203">this</a> one, 
which happens to be my favorite one and extremely high quality from my usage, and you can buy it alongside a DS flashcard. What a steal!
<br>
Next, you're going to want to disconnect the Pi's micro USB, place the micro sd card from your Pi, into the T-FLASH, followed by
placing the T-FLASH, or your preferred reader, into the PC. Next, you're going to want to change the following value as shown in the pic, or it won't
connect:

<br>
From there, eject the SD card, remove it from the T-FLASH, and place
it in the Pi, then power on the Pi and DoraOS will automatically connect over ethernet.
<br>
Next, you're going to want to flip on and off the switch on your power strip, with a five second interval, 
abd you're going to want to turn on your Pi's HDMI monitor and login, then note down the IP it gives you.
<br>
Next open Putty, and place that IP in the IP box,
<br>
Next, name your profile and hit save settings.
<br>
Next, hit Open.
<br>
Next, login with root, and password "dietpi" without quotes., and be sure to change your password by using the
"passwd" command if you feel like it.
<br>
You've now connected!
