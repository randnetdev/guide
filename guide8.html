Hi, and welcome to section 8.
<br>
There's a few things we need to do to get our prod enviroment running:
<br>
1. Run "apt install make"
2. Run "curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/randnetdev/firmware/master/dns_zones-hosts.txt >> /etc/pihole/custom.list"
<br>
And that will get your DNS server configured!=
