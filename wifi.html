Hi, and welcome to the internet connection guide for DoraOS.
<br>
You're going to need a few pieces of hardware to do this:
<br>
First off, you're going to need a micro SD card reader. Might we suggest <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/184901848203">this</a> one, 
which happens to be my favorite one and extremely high quality from my usage, and you can buy it alongside a DS flashcard. What a steal!
<br>
Next, the other thing you will need, is a NETGEAR AC1200. This is very important to the hotspot process, and in our testing worked the best.
<br>
You can buy one <a href="https://www.amazon.com/NETGEAR-AC1200-Wi-Fi-Adapter-A6210-100PAS/dp/B00MRVJY1G?th=1">here</a>.
<br>
Once you have obtained both of these, install Connectify, which you can find a cracked version on either FileCR or RSLOAD, or download a trial,
depending on your preferences, and install Netgear A2610 Genie, which you can download and install
<a href="https://www.downloads.netgear.com/files/GDC/A6210/A6210_V1.0.0.39.zip">here</a>, and make sure your AC1200 is connected during the install, or
it will not work.<br>
Next, after connecting to your preferred access point, specify the following connection parameters: <br>

<br>
And hit start hotspot.
<br>
From there, power on the Pi and DoraOS will automatically connect to this access point.
