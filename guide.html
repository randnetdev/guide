Hello. I'm going to show you section 1 of how to install DoraOS.
<br>
DoraOS was made a anonymous developer who wishes to not be named, but was made specifcally for Dora's project.
<br>
First off, you're going to want to ask Dora for the firmware download link, and you should recieve a ZSD file.
<br>
From there, you're going to want to install  <a href="https://github.com/mcmilk/7-Zip-zstd/releases/download/v21.03-v1.5.0-R2/7z21.03-zstd-x64.exe">this</a>
and run the installer, and hit Install. You'll also want to install Win32DiskImager,
which can be found <a href="https://netactuate.dl.sourceforge.net/project/win32diskimager/Archive/win32diskimager-1.0.0-install.exe">here</a> and lastly,
you'll want to install Putty, which can be found <a href="https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/w64/putty-64bit-0.78-installer.msi">here</a>
<br>
From there, you're set to begin. Right click on the zsd file and go to 7Zip-ZS>Extract files... and specify a location where you want your firmware to be
extracted.
<br>
Then, open Win32DiskImager, and select the 32GB SD Card you are flashing to (IT WILL NOT WORK WITH ANY SD CARDS SMALLER), then select the
  DoraOS_BG3LN79ZEFHGXDGTVTA88CNUDD4RCVKK_Firmv1.img file, and hit write. This will write it in a raw format to your SD card.
