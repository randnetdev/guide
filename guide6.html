Hi, and welcome to section 6.
<br>
Firstly, you're going to want to do "apt install nano", followed by "cat /etc/resolv.conf" and note down the IP after the nameserver, somewhere.
It should look something like in the pic, a little, but with IP with the pattern 172.16.10.x (read below)

<br>
At this point I am assuming you've set your DHCP range to 172.16.10.1-172.16.10.255 in your router, if not:
<br>
Please follow this: <br>
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-e&q=change+your+dhcp+range+in+your+router">
https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-e&q=change+your+dhcp+range+in+your+router</a> and find your router's guide
on how to change it. A good router for doing so is the Cisco RV042G, which is what I use, and can be bought 
<a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/255858178613">here</a>.
<br>
Next, you're going to want to do "sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf" and if you have ethernet, put the first line as
"interface <strong>eth0</strong>" but if you did the WiFi guide, do "interface <strong>wlan0</strong>"
<br>
For the second line, do "static ip_address=<strong>172.16.10.30</strong>/24"
<br>
For the third line, you'll need your computer for this. Do Windows Key + R and type in cmd, and hit ok. It'll look a little something like this:
<br>

<br>
Next, in your command prompt, type in "ipconfig". You'll see something like default gateway, as shown by the red line in my example:

<br>
Sometimes, checking your network adapter name, but not in my example, can help, espically if you have Fortinet. 
I will show what network adapters can look like
in your device manager, ut we will skip that for this tutorial, as it wasn't in my case.

<br>
Then, for the third line, put "static routers=<strong>ROUTER_IP</strong>" and replace ROUTER_IP with the gateway IP you found in the previous step.
<br>
Finally, for the fourth line, put "static domain_name_servers=<strong>DNS_IP</strong>" while replacing DNS_IP with the nameserver IP you got
at the beginning of this guide. Obviously your DHCP ranges, and beginnings will be different, but here is what the syntax might look like:

<br>
<br>
Your DNS server IP should now work with the N64! Reboot and move on to the next section, well done! :)
